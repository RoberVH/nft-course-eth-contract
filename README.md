## Gihub Web Dapp to connect tho this this  contract is on: 
https://github.com/RoberVH/nft-course-buildspace

It's based on buildspace.so course contract and this is my rendition

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
